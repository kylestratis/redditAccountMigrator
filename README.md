# redditAccountMigrator

This is mainly up to have a backup, if you intend to use this as a standalone script, you will need to follow the steps [here](https://github.com/SmBe19/praw-OAuth2Util/blob/master/OAuth2Util/README.md#reddit-config) to log in. You will also need to make two config files, currently creatively titled 'olduserconfigfile.txt' and 'newuserconfigfile.txt'. More sophisticated handling of this will be implemented at some point. 

## Todo
* Handle config filenames more elegantly
* Make a verbose option to read out subreddits subscribing and unsibscribing to
* Make prettier
* Make a debug option for writing subreddits to logfile
* More efficient sub/unsub procedures
